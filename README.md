# 1nsane-ASL
Autosplitter script for the game 1nsane (2000)

Features:
- Auto start timer. LiveSplit timer must be reset, press 'Go' on any race and it should start timer.
- Auto splitting. After race is finished and you see 'You win' screen, split is done.
- Load removal. Script looks for 'in menu' or 'in game' memory addresses and if both are 0, that means game is loading. If you use Game Time timer in LiveSplit, timer should pause during that period.
